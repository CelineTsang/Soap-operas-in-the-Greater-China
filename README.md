# Background & Motivation
As we started this project, we want to choose a topic with universality which can touch everyone's daily life. Recently, one of the hottest topics through mainland China and Hong Kong is the soap opera,Story of Yanxi Palace. We considered that Soap Opera could be a good topic.
So, we tried to scrape DOUBAN.COM, the most influential online database about film, books and music in the great China. Then, stories emerged. The true problem is doing subtraction. What kinds of information are valuable? How to make our story useful to the audience? 
After our study, we found that the output value of Chinese TV dramas industry is getting bigger and bigger, so do the traffic of them, but not all in a good way. Much so-called popular soap opera is well-known for its low quality instead of merit. As members-to-be of the media industry, we have a simple idea that we want to see more excellent TV drama with both of fame and fortune. As a result, we decided and discussed this topic, how to make a soap opera with fame & fortune soap opera, which named The 3C Formula Of FFSO.
